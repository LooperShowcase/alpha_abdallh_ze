      <hr><hr/>
      The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a
      sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation
      beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix,
      meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3] The initial four
      generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth
      generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May
      2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota
      Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70
      Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also
      stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the
      similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for
      the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the
      Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the
      fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The
      5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz,
      Austria by Magna Steyr. The Supra traces much of its roots back to the
      2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were
      offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine.
      Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along
      with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was
      derived from the original Celica logo, being blhct gfccbcbc
      without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991
      when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. The dragon logo was
      a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first
      two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas.
      The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also
      discontinued.[citation needed] In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the
      fourth-generation Supra in the United States.[6] Production of the
      fourth-generation Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January
      2019, the fifth-generation Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 BMW
      Z4, was introduced.[7
